# Blynk_Examples
some examples of pushing the raspberry pi data to blynk IoT

Blynk is a popular and user-friendly Internet of Things (IoT) platform that enables individuals, makers, and developers to create and control IoT projects easily. It simplifies the process of building IoT applications, mobile apps, and hardware interactions, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced developers.

Certainly, let's break down the code of ON_VIRTUAL_CHANGE:

1. `import BlynkLib`: This line imports the BlynkLib library, which is used to interact with the Blynk IoT platform.

2. `BLYNK_AUTH = 'YourAuthToken'`: Here, you need to replace `'YourAuthToken'` with your actual Blynk Auth Token. The Auth Token is a unique identifier that associates your hardware or script with your Blynk project.

3. `blynk = BlynkLib.Blynk(BLYNK_AUTH)`: This line initializes a Blynk object using your Auth Token. It establishes a connection between your hardware (in this case, assumed to be a Raspberry Pi) and the Blynk platform.

4. `@blynk.on("V3")`: This line registers a virtual pin handler for virtual pin V3. Virtual pins are used to communicate between your hardware and the Blynk mobile app. In this case, it's set up to handle data sent to V3.

5. `def v3_write_handler(value)`: This defines a function `v3_write_handler` that will be called when data is received on virtual pin V3. The function takes a `value` argument, which will contain the data sent to V3.

6. `print('Current slider value: {}'.format(value[0]))`: Inside the `v3_write_handler` function, this line prints the received data to the console. It displays the value sent to virtual pin V3. The `[0]` is used to access the first element of the `value` list, which should contain the data.

7. `while True: blynk.run()`: This is an infinite loop that continually runs the `blynk.run()` function, which handles communication between your Raspberry Pi and the Blynk platform. It ensures that your Raspberry Pi stays connected and can send/receive data as needed.

In summary, this code sets up a connection to the Blynk platform using your Auth Token, registers a handler for virtual pin V3, and prints the data received on V3 to the console. It continuously runs, allowing your Raspberry Pi to communicate with the Blynk app and respond to data sent to V3.
